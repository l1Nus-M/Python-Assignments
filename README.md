# WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT.
# Instructions:
Basic Calculator Program.
- Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.
4. Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
5. Remove the last element from my_list.
6. Sort my_list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.


# WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT.
1. Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

# WEEK 5 ASSIGNMENT.
OOP Assignment

Description:
Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
1. Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
2. Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
3. Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
4. Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
